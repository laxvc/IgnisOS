# IgnisOS Architecture

## Overview
IgnisOS is a Unix-based operating system designed to provide a modular and efficient environment for users. This document outlines the key architectural components of IgnisOS and their interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. Kernel
- **Description**: The core component of IgnisOS, responsible for managing hardware resources, system calls, and process scheduling.
- **Modules**:
  - Process Management
  - Memory Management
  - File System Management
  - Device Drivers

### 2. User Space
- **Description**: The environment where user applications and processes run, separated from kernel space for security and stability.
- **Components**:
  - System Libraries
  - User Applications
  - Command-Line Interface (CLI)

### 3. File System
- **Description**: The structure used to manage files on the disk.
- **Design**: IgnisOS supports multiple file systems, including:
  - Ext4
  - FAT32

### 4. Device Drivers
- **Description**: Software components that allow the kernel to communicate with hardware devices.
- **Types**:
  - Block Device Drivers
  - Character Device Drivers

### 5. Networking
- **Description**: The subsystem responsible for handling network communications.
- **Protocols Supported**:
  - TCP/IP
  - UDP

## Design Principles
- **Modularity**: Components are designed as independent modules to allow for easy updates and maintenance.
- **Security**: IgnisOS implements security features to protect user data and system integrity.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized resource management ensures minimal overhead and maximal performance.

## Future Directions
- **Planned Features**: Future versions of IgnisOS aim to include advanced security features, improved user interfaces, and support for new hardware architectures.

## Conclusion
The architecture of IgnisOS is designed to provide a robust foundation for building a modern operating system. The modular approach ensures that the system can evolve over time while maintaining stability and performance.
